# Idea and concept of your overall project
Through this project, we are going to analyze music over the decades and see what makes a hit song. However, since this has been done before, we are doing to go a little more in depth with our research. We are going to analyze various songs of various genres over the decades and see what sonic attributes they all share. On top of that, we are going to analyze what was popular in certain genres during certain decades, and seeing what changed over the years and see what was the cause for that (for example, analyzing pop in the 1980’s with someone like Michael Jackson, and comparing him with Justin Timberlake of the early 2000’s). 

# Description of data that is required
Use Spotify to find the sonic attributes of the songs over various decades, as Spotify has one of the most extensive streaming libraries available. These attributes include things like BPM, timbre, scales and many other things of the same vein. Used Wikipedia to look up charts and year data about artists and songs.

# How you used python to collect the data
First used Spotify to gather the codes for each song, sorted in a spreadsheet. We then used a Python code along with the Spotify API to gather the data and store it in a file.

# Sample of the data collected
Showcase the spreadsheet and the data files.

# Difficulties faced and lessons learned
Learning to use credentials with an API as well as how to best store the unique data types that Spotify uses in a file so they can be read by later parts of the project.

# Next steps towards your project
Use MatLab to read in the sonic attributes, analyze the attributes, construct and plot trend lines. Then use Ruby to create an interface that can show results and other trends.
